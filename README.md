- 👋 Hi, I’m @luishhatashita
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code in order to merge those interests with main area of expertise (mechanical engineering, and hopefully aerospace)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, besides my undergraduate degree (on the 8th out 10 semeters)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I'm still not sure about which area I should focus, however, I'm interested in learning. So any oportunity would help me develop better my skills.
- 📫 How to reach me by my personal email: luishenrique1508@gmail.com
